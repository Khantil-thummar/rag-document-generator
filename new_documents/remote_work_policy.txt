1. Remote Work Policy

1.1 Overview
TechNova Solutions embraces a flexible, remote-first work culture. We believe that team members can be productive and collaborative from anywhere in the world. This policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for remote work at TechNova.

1.2 Remote Work Philosophy
At TechNova, we trust our team members to manage their time effectively and deliver results regardless of their physical location. Our remote-first approach enables us to:
- Attract top talent from around the world
- Promote work-life balance and employee well-being
- Reduce environmental impact through less commuting
- Enable flexible schedules that accommodate diverse lifestyles
- Create an inclusive environment for caregivers and those with mobility challenges

1.3 Eligibility
All TechNova team members are eligible for remote work unless their specific role requires on-site presence. Roles that may require office attendance include:
- Positions requiring specialized equipment only available on-site
- Roles with significant in-person client interaction requirements
- Positions designated as essential on-site personnel

1.4 Remote Work Requirements
To work remotely at TechNova, team members must:

- Maintain reliable high-speed internet connection (minimum 50 Mbps recommended)
- Be available during core collaboration hours (10 AM - 3 PM in your local timezone)
- Respond to messages and requests within a reasonable timeframe during work hours
- Maintain professional appearance and background for video calls
- Ensure the security of company data and equipment

1.5 Communication Expectations
Effective communication is essential for remote teams. Team members should:
- Use Slack for day-to-day communication and quick questions
- Use email for formal communications and external correspondence
- Schedule video calls for complex discussions and team meetings
- Update their calendar with availability and time off
- Set status messages when unavailable or in focus time

1.6 Asynchronous Work
TechNova encourages asynchronous communication to accommodate team members across different time zones:
- Document decisions and discussions in writing for those not present
- Record important meetings for team members who cannot attend live
- Use collaborative tools like Notion and Google Docs for shared work
- Avoid expecting immediate responses outside of core hours
- Respect colleagues' time zones when scheduling meetings
